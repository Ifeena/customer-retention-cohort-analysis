# Cohort Analysis for Assessing Customer Retention in E-commerce Industry - customer-retention-cohort-analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on performing cohort analysis to assess customer retention within the e-commerce industry. Cohort analysis helps in understanding customer behavior and retention patterns by grouping customers based on their acquisition date and analyzing their behavior over time.

# Data Description
The dataset includes customer transaction records with the following key columns:
- *CustomerID:* A unique identifier for each customer, allowing for customer-specific analysis and tracking of individual purchasing behavior.
- *InvoiceDate:* The date and time when invoice was generated, offering insights into when purchases where made and allowing for temporal analysis.
- *Quantity:* The number of units of a product that were included in the transaction, indicating the purchase volume for each item.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*Data Cleaning*
- Missing Values: Identified and handled missing values.
- Date Parsing: Ensured that InvoiceDate is in the correct date format.

*Visualizations*
- Customer Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of customers across different periods.
- Sales Trend Visualization: Visualized trends in sales over time to understand purchasing behavior and seasonal effects.

# Cohort Analysis
- Cohorts were defined based on the month of the first purchase. Each cohort includes customers who made their first purchase in a specific month.

*Analysis*
- Cohort Retention Matrix: Created a matrix showing the retention rates for each cohort over time.
- Retention Trends: Analyzed how retention rates change as cohorts age.

*Visualization*
- Heatmaps: Visualized cohort retention rates using heatmaps to identify patterns and trends.

# Insights and Findings
- *Retention Trends:* Identified patterns in customer retention over different periods.
- *Cohort Performance:* Analyzed which cohorts performed better in terms of retention and engagement.
- *Behavioral Patterns:* Discovered behavioral patterns associated with higher retention rates.

# Challenges Faced
1. *Data Quality:* Addressed issues with missing or inconsistent data.
2. *Cohort Definition:* Determined the appropriate time periods for cohort grouping.
3. *Retention Metrics:* Developed effective metrics to measure and compare retention.

# Recommendations for Future Work
Here are some of my recommendations for further analysis:
1. *Extended Analysis:* Consider analyzing additional variables such as customer demographics or product categories.
2. *Segmentation:* Perform segmentation analysis to understand different customer segments' behavior.
3. *Predictive Modeling:* Explore predictive modeling techniques to forecast future retention trends.

# Conclusion
The cohort analysis provided valuable insights into customer retention patterns in the e-commerce industry. By analyzing retention rates across different cohorts, we identified key trends and opportunities for improving customer retention strategies.
